# Probabilistic Inference
[Mark van der Wilk](https://mvdw.uk)

Lecture materials for the Imperial College London course on Probabilistic Inference, in the Department of Computing. Lecture recordings are available on [Panopto](https://imperial.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=62a333d5-34a8-4c0b-a678-aedd015a809f).
<!-- Some material is based on an earlier version of the course by Marc Deisenroth. --> 

## Contributing
I welcome any suggestions and fixes from students. If you want to make a contribution, please fork the repo, and make a pull request. If you make a fix, you can claim a chocolate bar at a lecture.
